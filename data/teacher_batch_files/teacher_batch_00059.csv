I've been practicing Reiki for 2 years and decided to bring Vipassana Meditation into my practice as well. 

 For those that aren't familiar with Reiki here is a simple explanation. Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by light touch of hands, but not all practitioners use touch and it is based on the idea that an unseen ""life force energy"" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's ""life fore energy"" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress. A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results.
 Vispassana Meditation is bringing the mind and body together and seeing things as they are. I also love to write and record guided meditations for all parts of our lives.
