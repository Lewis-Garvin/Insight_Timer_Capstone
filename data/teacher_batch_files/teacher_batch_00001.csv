Português, Français, 普通話 and Español",Joined in Sep 2016,"Ajahn Achalo was born in Australia in 1972. He developed a keen interest in meditation at the age of twenty and a year later left for Thailand to study Buddhism more intently.  After a two year period practising in various centres and monasteries, in 1996 Ajahn Achalo ordained as a Bhikkhu (monk) under Ajahn Liem at Wat Pah Pong, the monastery founded by venerable Ajahn Chah. Although most of his training has taken place in Thailand, Ajahn Achalo has also lived in several International Forest Monasteries in the Ajahn Chah lineage.  

Ajahn Achalo is deeply grateful for his many opportunities to study with well-practiced monks, as well as for having been able to train in several traditional contexts, including meditation monasteries, remote forests, and periods on pilgrimage. 

During his years of training, he has received personal guidance from many remarkable teachers, among them, Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Pasanno, Ajahn Jayasaro and Ajahn Kalyano. For most of his Bhikkhu life, he has considered Tan Ajahn Anan, abbot of Wat Marp Jan, to be his principal mentor. In addition, he has found the Dalai Lama's instructions and example to be of tremendous value.
