Welcome to Rachel Braunscheidel's cozy little space for relaxing, self-compassionate guided medis. She created this space for gentle encouragement and soothing for spoonies and all those on a healing journey. Her short audio messages are guided relaxation, heart-to-heart conversation, and ASMR whispering styled. They are kept quiet to be gentle towards the sensory sensitive, and kept under 15 minutes so they don't take up too much of your precious energy. It is Rachel's hope that these little messages will help you feel more soothed, inspired, befriended, and encouraged through your healing journey.

Special consideration: when Rachel uses the terms, ""spoonie"" and ""chronic illness"", She is referring to her personal experience with neuro-immune illnesses ME/CFIDS and POTS.
