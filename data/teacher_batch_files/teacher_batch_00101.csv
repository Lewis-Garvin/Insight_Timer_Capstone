Ambitionen är att hjälpa privatpersoner och företag att nå sina mål och drömmar. Fokus ligger i att behålla ett lugn. När vi är lugna och harmoniska fattar vi kloka och visa beslut och blir inte lika lätt uppjagade över småsaker, vilket i sin tur leder till en bättre hälsa. Det sägs ju ofta att stress är skadligt för vår hälsa, men stämmer det verkligen? En mycket intressant studie från universitetet i Wisconsin säger att det beror på vad DU TROR om stress. Och det gäller i alla avseenden, vad du tror om saker och ting har en mycket stor påverkan på ditt liv. Dina övertygelser styr ditt liv.

Madeleine Magnusson hjälper dig att identifiera dina övertygelser, får förståelse hur din stenåldershjärna fungerar och hjälper dig behålla fokus, samt ge dig kraftfulla verktyg för att nå dina mål.

My passion to teach Mindfulness is fueled by an ever deepening and profound appreciation for the dependability of this ancient practice.   My practice began 25 years ago when I was introduced to Mindfulness while earning my degree in Philosophy from Buffalo State College with an emphasis in Eastern Philosophy and its practical applications.  My experience includes 25 years of Mindfulness training and practice under the guidance of Dr. George Hole (Distinguished Professor, Philosophical Counselor, Mentor), retreats with Thich Nhat Hanh (internationally renowned teacher, monk, author and peace activist) and meditation instruction with experts in China, Japan, Vietnam, India and Burma. In January 2014, I created, coordinated and implemented the first Mindfulness Program for the Institute for Shipboard Education, Semester at Sea, leading over 100 students, faculty and staff through an 8-Week Mindfulness  Course.  I counseled faculty and staff in developing coping strategies for students experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, facilitated several  mindfulness process groups and led guided mindfulness meditation throughout the semester long voyage.   Most recently in August 2016, I traveled to Kenya and taught mindfulness for the faculty and staff at Woodland Star International School.  
Locally in Buffalo, New York I have taught Mindfulness at Univera Health, Independent Health,  M&T Bank, Seneca Niagara, NCCC, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo State College, The Hemophilia Center of WNY,  Dent Neurological, Sacred Heart Academy, The Garrett Club, Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and to a variety of other groups and individual clients throughout Western New York and abroad. I teach Mindfulness as way of reducing stress and unleashing the innate potential we all have to live our lives with greater calm, clarity and stability. My clientele come from multiple disciplines and all walks of life including business owners and healthcare professionals, attorneys, students, artists, educators and parents. 
While incorporating a patient and compassionate approach, I offer a unique skill set that allows students to access the root cause of their actual stressors, while learning to manage them effectively from within.  I offer courses in the classroom setting as well as private instruction and have helped numerous people overcome their struggles with a variety of issues and conditions including stress (work related, financial, family/relationship or health), sleeping disorders, anxiety, high blood pressure, chronic pain, fatigue, headaches and other problems inhibiting one’s quality of life. ...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/a2E9R9A0K2r6h8A3r5G3a2U3m9u2w6K4C2q6C3m2g0v9T5F6s2F3x4n0h6N8d9D8N7H1X1S3X1M1u0F7u6f0s7k4g4F0N8P0e5r2/pictures/square_medium.jpeg

Ik ben geïnteresseerd in Body-Mind Medicine en geef Mindfulnesstrainingen en Compassietraingen aan kleine groepen of als individueel traject in Rotterdam.

Lid VMBN (Vereniging Mindfulness-Based Trainers in Nederland en Vlaanderen) categorie 1, lidmaatschapnummer 2013354.

In 2007 heb Mindfulness leren kennen en sindsdien beoefen ik Mindfulness. De beoefening van Mindfulness brengt mij plezier, meer bewust (intenser) aanwezig zijn en een meer milde,
accepterende houding. Ook voor moeilijke momenten in mijn leven.
In 2008 ben ik lid geworden van Zen Rotterdam. Jaarlijks volg ik één of meerdere retraites, bijvoorbeeld bij Rob Brandsma , Frits Koster en Zen Rotterdam.

Ik vind het fijn om mensen in Mindfulness te begeleiden en te zien hoe ieder er voor zichzelf uit kan halen wat op dat moment in zijn/haar leven past. Om daar aan bij te kunnen dragen geeft mij voldoening en plezier.

Teaching became second nature to her. 
 
A singer from an early age her stage experience took her into all genres of performance art. She established Heartspace Music Record Label and Studio in 2009 and has released 3 audio CDs ""Sacred Love I (2017) “Within Your Heart, (2013) “Alaya-Nam” (2012).  Although classically trained, Mohini now integrates all her ancestral influences into her original compositions, which include Sacred Mantras, modern ballads with a “spiritual, world feel” and Spontaneous Sacred Sound.
 
Self-inquiry drew Mohini into the world of Yoga.  Foremost,  a practitioner of yoga, then a teacher.  She weaves all aspects of yoga, i.e. the energetic, metaphysical and psychological components of what makes us human as well as the physical, and material into an eclectic, synergistic discipline and practice.  She teaches because she is passionate about personal and universal well-being and internal, spiritual growth.  She subscribes to the ""starfish"" effect, that if one person is changed by what comes through her teaching and it makes a difference to their life, then she has fulfilled her role as a teacher.
 
For Mohini, teaching the ancient practices of all components of yoga and the continuous exploration into sacred sound, is a privilege, and on ongoing journey of discovery. It is the ""road to freedom"". As much as her students may derive benefits from what she offers, she equally is nourished and energised by her teaching. 
 
Mohini published “Yogaflows” (book) in 2002, and teaches an individual style of dynamic, vinyasa and yin yoga. She is also a qualified Holistic Massage Therapist, as well as a teacher of Tai Chi for Health and Qi Gong Instructor.  She currently teaches Tai Chi to older folk, who derive not only the benefits of the discipline, but also from the community spirit and humour.
 
Her current project ""The Voice of Yoga"" is a unique synthesis of Dynamic and Yin Yoga, Sacred and Spontaneous Sound and Mohini's original compositions. She offers one day or half day workshop/events nationally and internationally.
