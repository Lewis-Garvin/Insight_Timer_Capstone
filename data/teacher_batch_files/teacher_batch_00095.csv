I began practicing meditation in 1989. While it did help the sometimes crippling suicidal depression I suffered from, I was inconsistent with my practice. It was not until 2012, when I developed Fibromyalgia and hip dysplasia in both of my hips that caused me severe limitations in daily activities, like walking, that I knew I had to make a change. 

The first class I took was Mindful Self-Compassion and it changed my life. Every part of my body and mind told me that this was the way of facilitating true change in my life.  I quickly realized that I wanted to share the insights I found through my mindfulness practice. Mindfulness changed and continues to change my life in profound and unexpected ways.

He has held previous posts at the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit in Cambridge and the University of Wales, Bangor. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the British Academy.
 
His research is concerned with psychological models and treatment of depression and suicidal behaviour, particularly the application of experimental cognitive psychology to understanding the processes that increase risk of suicidal behaviour in depression. With colleagues John Teasdale (Cambridge) and Zindel Segal (Toronto) he developed Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for prevention of relapse and recurrence in depression, and many clinical trials have found that MBCT significantly reduces the recurrence rate in those who have suffered the most severe and long-lasting depression. In Great Britain, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), working on behalf the National Health Service, has recommended MBCT as a primary treatment for prevention relapse in depression. His current research focuses on whether mindfulness can help prevent depression in teens.
