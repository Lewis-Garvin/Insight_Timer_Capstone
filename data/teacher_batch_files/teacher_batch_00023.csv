It was this interest which introduced her to Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine which she went on to study. It was during her studies that she turned to a regular Ashtanga practise to balance the demands of school. Ashtanga transformed her practise of yoga to such a degree that her passion to teach surfaced. 

Christy completed her RYT 250 at Moksana Yoga Centre, Victoria, Canada in 2010 and has taught since then from Victoria to Melbourne after a move to Australia in 2011. 

Christy is currently practising Karma Yoga, working as a Volunteer Coordinator for the non-profit Cultural Yoga Project, which offers yoga and community to refugees and asylum seekers. Christy teaches Vinyasa, Hatha, Yin and Yoga Nidra as an E-RYT 200 Level teacher. Her class styles aim to offer ways of achieving balanced strength and deep release to improve mobility and performance, thus leading to better physical and mental health. Yoga to her is about overall freedom for body and mind with the opportunity for self reflection and growth. 

When not teaching you may find her adventuring northside by bike taking photos and op-shopping, hiking or sitting at the beach on a sunny day, or taking time at home to read and study.
