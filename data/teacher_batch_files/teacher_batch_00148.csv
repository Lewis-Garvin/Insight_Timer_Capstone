She instinctively knew that something in that room pulsing with the strange didgeridoo music was meant to change her life.  From that first class on, she immediately craved the physical movement and thoughtful awareness that yoga offered.  Years later, when her first baby was tragically born still, she knew that it was also a lifeline; Tracey’s experience on her mat could be translated into how she lived her life when she wasn’t wearing yoga pants or trying to get her ankle behind her head.  Dealing with frustrations within the practice (like that darned peacock pose) taught her how to deal with higher stakes emotions, such as grief and despair when she was off the mat. 

Driven by her desire to empower others in their personal journeys off of the mat through the asana, much as she had herself experienced, she decided to serve others by becoming a yoga teacher.  In 2007, she studied with her teacher, Deahna Brown and benefited from her insightful and inspiring wisdom.  She expanded her knowledge in 2015 by attending advanced yoga studies at the Colorado School of Yoga in Boulder, Colorado with Gina Caputo, whose intelligent sequencing and impassioned offering has challenged her to embrace each class she teaches as an opportunity for extraordinary consciousness. 

Tracey has an approachable and down-to-earth style that attracts students who may be apprehensive about practicing yoga.  She is a natural teacher who meets students where they are and supports them in both accepting modifications while continuing to challenge themselves.  Tracey recognizes that people vary greatly in how they learn.  As an experienced teacher both in the classroom and the studio, she is uniquely poised to teach in such a way that all students can benefit from the practice.

In addition to being an Experienced Registered Yoga Teacher (E-RYT 500) with Yoga Alliance and a Certified Prenatal Yoga Teacher, Tracey has a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, Masters of Arts in Education and was awarded Gold in the category of Best Yoga Teacher in the Springs in the Gazette’s Best of the Springs 2015 and 2018 editions.  Additionally, she is the Dean of Students and a teacher on the faculty for the Colorado School of Yoga.

I have practiced meditation, mostly Zen (Zazen) for over 25 years, which has lead me to learning the very meditative Japanese bamboo flute, the Shakuhachi. The style that I study is hundreds of years old, and was played by monks to help in their focus during meditation. The compositional theory of this style of music provides one of the foundations to my work. My currently available pieces do not feature the shakuhachi, but use a variety of gentle ambiences and organic sounds to create deep calm and aid focus. Future works will feature the Shakuhachi occasionally.

My music is designed to boost concentration and create a smooth flow through the various phases of meditation, however it is also suitable for yoga and similar activites, or simply to help you relax. New work is in production, and selected works from each upcoming release will be made available first and for free to the Insight Timer community.

I have been a user of insight timer since its early days. My time is devoted to ecologically and socially sustainable design projects, personal coaching, making music and my family. I invite you to connect with me through this community and share with me your experiences with my music. Enjoy!
