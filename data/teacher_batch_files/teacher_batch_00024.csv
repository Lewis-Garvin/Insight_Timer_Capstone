Suddenly, I was given a ""command"" which said that ""we humans could heal ourselves with sound, color and vibration.""

It would take many years of listening, healing and working toward the ultimate goal of creating a space, a sanctuary for self-healing and spiritual education. However, it would take my mother's death for the real healing to begin. 

Windfall, The Trilogy CD is a tribute to my mother's loving spirit who continues to guide and ring those eternal bells of hope and joy because...

""All true healing comes from within, when we are at peace with ourselves.""

Thank you, Colleen
