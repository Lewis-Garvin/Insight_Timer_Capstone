ごく平凡な家庭に生まれ育ち、小さいころの夢は、早く大人になって自由になること。
大学卒業後、上場企業に就職するも、「色んな国で生活してみたい！」という夢に突き動かされ退職。世界中の様々な国で働きながら旅を続ける。これまでに住んだ国は、イギリス、オーストラリア、タイなど。訪れた国は、フランス、スペイン、ハンガリー、中国、フィリピン、ペルーなどなど。
20代半ば、小さいころからの夢、経済的、時間的な自由を手にするも「何か違う。」と感じ始める。五体満足、仕事も交友関係も順調なのに、いつも何かに不満があり「もっと、もっと」と常に何かを求めている自分に気づき、自分の追い求めていた「自由」ってなんだろうと疑問を持つようになる。
そんな中、2005年にニュージーランドで仏教に出会う。「全ての苦しみの根源は「自分」という幻想から生まれている。そして、真の意味の自由は、「自分」という幻想から目覚めることにある。」という言葉を聞き、今までに聞いたこともない不思議なコンセプトだけれど、強く心を惹かれるものを感じ、以後これまでチベット仏教、禅の教え、瞑想を学び続ける。カナダにあるDharma Center of Canadaで6カ月間のリトリートにも参加。そして、今日まで少しずつ「自由」に執着している自分という幻想を手放すことで、ようやく、小さいころから自分の求めていた「自由」に出会う。そして、この自由をもっと多くの人と分かち合いたいという思いから、Choice-full Momentを2012年からスタートし、現在に至る。...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/R7Q3p2n5S2a5r9u3U5J7p5V4d0N5Z7E3u6c5y6r9h8p1n9Q1b5F9N3E8w3s1X4f2p0h9a6f4U6f5f8c4j6V5n0s8C3S0D8T5z1g0/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
