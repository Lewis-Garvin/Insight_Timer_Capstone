For the past ten years as a senior trainer for ETIA, Jo has included meditation as a key element of psychotherapy training.  She also utilizes meditation in her work with clients, which enhances therapy and results in positive outcomes.  
 
Somatic meditation, visualisation and the use of imagery naturally arising from a person’s inner world, is the focus of Jo’s meditations. The meditations support connection with the body, to access the innate wisdom each person has for their own healing and growth.
Whether in stillness or movement, in silence or with music, each person has their preferred style of meditation. A stance of curiosity and non-judgment supports body focus to bring awareness to sensations, emotions and energy.

He subsequently left the Buddhist Order and eventually developed his own approach to meditation in 1988, called, “Recollective Awareness Meditation.” Upon leaving the Buddhist Order, he returned to the US in 1990 to study counseling psychology and train as a psychotherapist. In 1996, he was at a crossroad in his career and decided against becoming a licensed psychotherapist in favor of teaching Recollective Awareness Meditation. The influence of his psychotherapy training on his meditation teaching is nonetheless palpable, and his students find his knowledge and experience in psychotherapy very helpful with the development of their meditation practice. He founded the Skillful Meditation Project in 1996, and began teaching meditation full time. Since then, he has led and taught many meditation retreats and workshops in the US and in UK, Germany, Austria, Finland, Netherlands, Australia, and India. He has worked with hundreds of meditation students, listening closely to their reports and reading their meditation journals. A number of meditation teachers have trained under him over the past 18 years, and have adapted his teachings and methods to fit their own teaching styles.

A Cum Laude graduate of the University of Michigan, her dance and exercise training skills have been enriched by her Master’s Degree education in Counseling Psychology.

The Chair Dancing® Fitness concept was born, when a fractured foot forced Ms. Stolove to conduct her dance and aerobic classes from a chair. Creativity born of necessity, resulted in her developing unique seated fitness programs combining the pleasure of exercise, dance, and music. While she “sat down” to bring exercise to meet the needs of anyone wanting to embrace exercise, the fitness industry took notice.

Chair Dancing® Fitness provides convenient and effective fitness routines done while comfortably seated. An alternative to high impact aerobics and gym workouts, Chair Dancing® Fitness improves muscle tone, flexibility and cardiovascular endurance. These medically sound programs are a fitness option for active people or those whose physical condition, restricted mobility or age, limit their participation in conventional forms of exercise.

Prominent health care facilities, including Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers, Eisenhower Medical Center, Scripps Clinic, and The Mayo Clinic, have offered this fitness alternative. The Chair Dancing® Fitness videos received a “Best Buy” award by Consumer Digest.

Now at 60 years of age, Ms. Stolove is standing up for exercise!  Her newest programs, Sit or Stand for Express Toning and Latin Soul and Rock n' Roll give every BODY an ""excuse-free"" exercise alternative.

In addition, Ms. Stolove continues to work as a dance instructor and performance coach. She particularly loves working with kids pursuing musical theatre. She also has helped countless people with their relationship to food, eating, self-concept and their body image. Ms. Stolove teaches her eating management style guiding people to a healthier relationship towards food, fun, and their self image.
