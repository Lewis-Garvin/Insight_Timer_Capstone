His search ended when he was drawn to India (1990) where he met his final teacher, Sri H.W.L Poonja, lovingly known as Papaji; a direct disciple of the renowned Indian Sage Ramana Maharshi.

Confirming Eli’s realization, his teacher sent him back into the world to share his unique psychological insights into the nature of egoic suffering in support of self-realization.

Eli infuses his teaching with his teacher’s living transmission of silence and peace.  He presents a unique map of egoic identification as a vehicle for ruthless self-inquiry and final realization of true freedom. His life is dedicated to passing on the transmission of his teacher.

Eli founded and currently teaches through The Leela Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to world peace and freedom through universal self-realization, as well as The Leela School.

He is a beloved teacher and practitioner and is truly a master of his craft.

Eric’s gifts were fostered as he spent his formative years in a unique community deep in the mountains of northern California that embraced many ancient healing techniques and spiritual practices. Witnessing the process of his father’s passing from cancer at a young age spurred him forward into his path of healing and spirituality. Eric became studied in the anatomy of the human body through the paramedics’ training program at Cabrillo College, and psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz. He has gained a deep understanding of the different treatments, both conventional and alternative, of illness and the emotional and physiological dynamics of disease. Eric has a unique ability for making his clients feel at ease and enjoy their sessions. His clients experience improvement and full recovery from conditions as varied as cancer, viral/bacterial/fungal/parasitical infections, genetic disorders, chronic fatigue, depression, diabetes, hormonal imbalances, chronic pain and many others.

Most of all his clients and students report many personal transformations including releasing negative patterns of thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and fears, and expanded success in their personal and professional lives. Eric has been a part of the development of ThetaHealing® since 2000, hosting Vianna Stibal in New York City multiple times, and has dedicated his life to the growth of ThetaHealing®. Eric is a mentor to his ThetaHealing® students and clients and has worked on over 11,000 people and trained over 1,000 students.

ThetaHealingNYC® has been Eric’s vision since his first session with Vianna Stibal, and he is proud to actualize this dream with his founding partners. He is a loving father to his two children Alanna and Drew and is grateful for his wonderful relationship with his life partner Sarah Faith.
