In the early days of his musical career, Ray Lynch was an unknown classically trained guitarist and lutenist, who began experimenting with innovative new music. His debut album, The Sky of Mind, (1983) artfully meshed his early classical music training with spatial melodies and the album became an underground success.  The album also drew on contemplative music Ray had written for the community of spiritual practitioners that he has been a part of since 1974. Not surprisingly, The Sky of Mind has been used by many over the years for meditation, spiritual healing, and other spiritual purposes. As it soothes, The Sky of Mind also moves the heart with rich evocative strings accented by soft Tibetan bells that have been associated with meditative practices for centuries. The album became an underground success.

When Ray released his second album, the groundbreaking Deep Breakfast, he and his wife Kathleen sold 50,000 copies out of their small apartment in San Rafael, CA before licensing the music to a distributor.  Ray's music began appearing in bookstores and gift shops everywhere, delighting and inspiring those who heard it.  People of nearly all ages wanted this album and almost overnight, mostly through word-of-mouth, demand for Ray's masterpiece soared.  As with all things worth having, good music stands the test of time, and today, Deep Breakfast has sold over 1.4 million albums. It was the first independently released album to be certified Gold by the R.I.A.A. and which later went Platinum.

Spirits soared with Ray's third album, the emotional and texturally vibrant No Blue Thing, which won 2 Billboard Awards and sold over 400,000 copies. Ray's fourth album, the classical Nothing Above My Shoulders but the Evening, features members of the San Francisco Symphony and surprises listeners with its feeling beauty and haunting melodies reflecting Ray's classical training.  With his newest album, Ray Lynch Best Of, fans are treated to a top-notch collection of Ray’s finest work, all digitally re-mastered for unprecedented sound quality.  Highlighting Best Of are two new songs ""Ralph's Rhapsody"", and ""The Music of What Happens"", plus a wonderfully infectious dance remix of ""Celestial Soda Pop"".
  
It's always better if someone else sings your praises, so we invite you to visit the ""Guestbook"" and ""Favorite Letters"" sections on Ray's website and  read how Ray's fans feel about his music.  You’ll find letters from judges, housewives, truck drivers, students, nurses, professors and children, to name but a few.  Ray's music gets better with each listen, and to date, his music has sold well over 2 million albums and won 3 Billboard Awards, all without the benefit of live performance or videos.
