During enormous amounts of sessions, which range from 1 hour to 5 hours I've seen and felt an incredible magic … it didn't matter where this experience took place. It has always been like a miracle. 

A transformation of thought into eternal smiling silence - at meditation festivals, yoga retreats, street festivals, concerts, mental institutes, elderly houses, small house gatherings and huge parties. 

I’m doing my best to stay with ""this energy"" no matter what surroundings are there, holding the space for those around to achieve a ""flying experience"" - at times it is very challenging yet always beneficial. 

I still have no idea what I do during these sessions, as it seems indeed, just holding a guitar, as it becomes much more than music - and its not about the music - and surely its not about me - but all that is involved in the process - either visible or invisible. Within this recording I tried to keep the original energy. Though surely it is never the same as it could be experienced Live!
