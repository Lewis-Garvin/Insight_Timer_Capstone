I am an Online Transformational Coach and Hypnotherapist and I help people all over the world to become the best versions of themselves, 
by leveraging the power of their mind. Using a combination of mindset work, guided visualisation and Hypnosis. 

The result? You can live a life free from inappropriate behavioural experiences and templates, that have formed anxiety, chronic stress, overwhelm, limiting beliefs and so much more. Allowing you to finally flourish in the knowledge you are bringing your best self to your own life, goals and visions.  

I’ll help you say goodbye to the constant drain of energy that is spent trying to keep you positive, so you can use that energy resource for other things.
 
We’ll work together on creating:
 
¥	More energy
¥	More focus
¥	Better clarity
¥	Better sleep
¥	Better relationships
¥	More money
¥	More abundance
 
I will show you how you can turn up every day being the best version of yourself with very little change.
 
I can show you how you can turn your visions and dreams into reality with very simple and easy to follow PROVEN steps.
 
As a qualified Solution Focused Clinical Hypnotherapist and Psychotherapist, combined with over 15 years’ experience of intuitive insight and first-hand support within mental health, I not only have the experience but the expertise to get you from where you are now to the best version of yourself every single day no matter what life throws at you.

Solution Focused Clinical Hypnotherapy helps you make positive changes in your life in a relatively short period of time.  Think of it as subconscious life coaching - I don't tell you what to do; instead we break down existing barriers to help you come up with new possibilities, ideas and alternative ways of seeing things which your subconscious has resisted in the past.
 
We never focus on problems or analyse the past, as that tends to reinforce those old behaviours and negative feelings.  Instead I help you to focus on the solutions and work towards your own goals for mental & physical wellbeing, using a combination of psychotherapy (Solution Focused Brief Therapy) and Clinical Hypnosis.  This combination is extremely effective in helping you make long-term changes in your thinking, behaviour and physical responses to stress, and can help with almost anything in your life that you would like to improve.
