It was when I took my first yoga class.  Back then you didn’t really do yoga for the physical aspect of the practice it was more for the spiritual connection,  and that's why I started practicing yoga.  I knew I needed a change in my life, I needed something that was going to help guide me to make some positive changes and bring some peace to my life, but I wasn’t quite sure what that looked like and thought yoga was a good place to start.  
The journey has been long but well worth it.  I recently completed my first meditation teacher training and have since cultivated a daily meditation practice that I look forward to everyday.  My practice helps to keep me grounded, centered and connected to my inner peace and I want to share that with you.
