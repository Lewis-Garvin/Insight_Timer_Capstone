9686,megblanchet,m,97,2022-12-12 04:19:29.555177,name found,Meg Blanchet,Eugene Or,820 followers,English,Joined in Sep 2016,"I have trained in various modalities of massage and bodywork, emotional processing, energy work, manual therapy, craniosacral therapy and spiritual counseling. Training and experience are important; knowing that one is not the source of a client’s healing, but simply a conduit, is also important. When I do my healing work, I center and call upon divine assistance; I feel a Presence by which I feel supported, energized and guided… I am a tool, not the source. (This is my experience and not something that I need to impose in any way.)

My intention is to come from a heart-centered place, free from ego that supports others in accessing those deep aspects of their Being that facilitate healing and integration. This is the context through which I hope you will read the following passages.

Over the last 4 decades, I have pursued training in a variety of modalities that range from very deep work to the most subtle: encompassing physical manipulation, psycho-emotional process, and energetic healing. The longer I have practiced the healing arts, the more I have gravitated toward methods that work directly with the inner guidance that can be accessed through energy, consciousness and the tissues themselves.

Through Hakomi Mindfulness-Centered Somatic Therapy, I came to have a profound appreciation for the innate wisdom that is an intrinsic component of every aspect of our being. An incredibly powerful client-centered method, it allows gentle access to the unconscious while the conscious mind is present. Practiced while in a state of mindfulness, the process is guided by the client’s curiosity; working to guide and support the client, the process of informing core material happens quite organically. I discovered Hakomi in 1983 and spent the next 15 years learning and teaching this method which is founded on Buddhist principles and practiced in the state of mindfulness. This method can be practiced alone or in combination with any number of disciplines, including bodywork, and for me has deeply influenced my way of life.

The bodywork methods I most prefer are osteopathic in origin and are extremely gentle, yet powerfully effective: Craniosacral Therapy, Functional Indirect, Integrative Manual Therapy and Lowen Systems.  (So much could be said about each method!) My training in energy work has also included MariEl, Reiki (Master,) BioEnergy and Qigong. Early on, I studied Integrative Structural Therapy in a 6-month program offered by the Rolfers at the Chicago Center for Advanced Bodywork as well as several extensive trainings in Deep Tissue Massage. In 1990, I received my Masters from Mundelein College in Spirituality and Counseling. My most recent training and certification was from the 3-year intensive training in Integrative Manual Therapy in Bloomfield CT where I was also certified by Sole Supports to fit custom made orthotics.

I also integrate the use of Bach Flower Remedies, California Essences and Young Living essential oils in my work and use tools such as the Avazzia, the cold laser, Aqua Qi footbath, the Vibraslim, and the Crystal Therapy Machine from the Casa de Dom Ignacio with John of God of Brazil.

My work is as unique as I am because it springs from my intuition, training and connection with Spirit. As a result, the work I do each session is uniquely responsive to the needs of the moment. I enjoy variety in my work: people come for different reasons and elicit different aspects of my training and experience. I am deeply grateful
