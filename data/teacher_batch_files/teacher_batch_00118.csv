By using techniques taught by Elders with the Ainu People and Shinto Leaders and Priests we put them in an easy video for you to follow along with. In order to grow in your path of Self Healing you must be open to the idea of Kami being present and available to aid you. We utilize the same ancient Japanese Shamanic Breathwork techniques and tap into a Meditation with Kami to cultivate a sense of peace and awareness of our connection with the environment, the Earth, and the Universe. 

What are Kami?

Peter travelled the world living and working for many years in the United Kingdom, Middle East, America, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and throughout Australia.

In 1993, at the age of 22, Peter spent time as a Buddhist monk in the rainforests of Thailand. During this period and since then, he has completed many meditation retreats, some up to as long as nine months in total solitary meditation.
