Before George began meditating, he was regularly making unhealthy decisions for his mind, body and spirit. After educating himself on Deepak Chopra's practices for wellbeing, he began incorporating more meditation and yoga into his life. By March of 2012 this spiritual toolkit had made such a drastic impact on him that he decided to go to The Chopra Center's signature meditation and yoga retreat known as ""Seduction of Spirit"". Here he learned the practice of Vedic Meditation, known as Primordial Sound Meditation and afterwards made the decision to make this practice a substantial part of his daily routine. George then went on and became a Certified Vedic Meditation instructor in June 2013 , a Certified Hatha Yoga teacher in November 2014, and a Ayurvedic Lifestyle Educator in February 2015. After learning to teach these practices, he currently teaches Vedic Meditation, Ayurveda and Hatha Yoga to students who are interested in physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing.
