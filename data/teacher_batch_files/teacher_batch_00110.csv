Her passion is helping people navigate their inner landscape, wisdom and purpose/path, by kindling the flames of self-inquiry. 

When she first learned about hypnosis she felt that is put words to something she had always felt a pull to and yet never found the modality / words for. What continues to energize her about hypnosis is the pace at which people can make changes and discover insights. It puts people in the driver seat of change, while working at the root of where patterns are fired and wired in the brain and subtle parts of us.

Marina's meditation and hypnosis tracks are made to make a powerful difference in people’s lives, disrupting the ordinary and the hussle and bussle of daily life to create a vortex of calm.
