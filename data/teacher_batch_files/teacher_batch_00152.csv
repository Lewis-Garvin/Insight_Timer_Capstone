Door het volgen van een van de digitale trainingen kunnen cursisten thuis leren om uit het hoofd te komen en meer met het gevoel te gaan leven. Om dit gevoel ook lichamelijk meer te kunnen gaan ervaren, wordt een belangrijk deel van de training besteed aan het regelmatig doen van lichamelijke (ontspannings)oefeningen. Deze oefeningen zijn hier terug te vinden en voor iedereen te beluisteren.

Direct beginnen!
De trainingen van het platform zijn direct beschikbaar voor iedereen die wil werken aan een balans tussen denken en voelen. Het helpt je stap-voor-stap om de rust weer terug te vinden in je leven. Je leert steeds beter luisteren naar je lijf en je gaat zelf bepalen wat je nodig hebt om die rust weer terug te vinden.

Door de digitale opzet kent het programma geen wachttijd en kun je na het aanschaffen van de inlogcode direct starten. Bovendien zorgt een digitale leeromgeving ervoor dat je zelf kunt bepaken wanneer en waar je inlogt om te oefenen en te leren.

Kenmerken digitale training:
V  Er is een digitale leeromgeving beschikbaar
V  De trainingen zijn helder en gestructureerd van opzet
V  Het bevat een combinatie van video, audio, theorie en opdrachten
V  De opdrachten en oefeningen zijn nauw op elkaar afgestemd
V  Je leert stap voor stap je denken en voelen te integreren
V  Er zijn 2 trainingen beschikbaar: Aanpak van Stress en Grip op je Gedrag

Hoe te volgen?
In beide programma's leer je op een praktische manier ánders met je gedachten en gevoelens om te gaan. De structuur en de digitale leeromgeving zorgen dat je stap voor stap kunt toewerken naar een balans. 
Deze trainingen zijn op diverse manieren te volgen:
- individueel met een coach naar keuze
