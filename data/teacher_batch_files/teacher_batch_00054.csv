I fully believe that the people in our lives are meant to be there for a reason. We're really just guiding each other home. Guided Grace Healing started off as a personal journey of self-love, back home to the true Me. I finally allowed myself to illuminate the parts of Me that I had decided to shut out, forget about & hide.

For the longest time of my journey back home to Me, I spent a lot of it repressing my fears, worries, doubts, insecurities, injustices, anger, loneliness & much more. I thought that if I placed a bandaid of positive affirmations and wishful thinking over my wounds, everything would be alright! Wrong.

​The hidden, dark and shadowy parts of Me (that I now love), came out to play in such intense and uncomfortable ways that I really had no choice but to dive in. DEEP. If you're familiar with astrology at all, you might be familiar with the Phoenix rising from the ashes when talking about the sign of Scorpio. I've told friends in the past that ""I wasn't born as a Scorpio for nothin'!"".

Constantly transforming, shedding, letting go, making space, feeling the feels, releasing, becoming, evolving, BEing. Aren't we all? What I'm trying to say here is that no matter where YOU are on your journey back home - I'm here for you. You can think of me as your Shadow Sister, Spiritual Tour Guide or simply put... a Friend. Listen, no one can do the healing FOR you. Why? Because you have literally ALL that you need to heal, from the inside out. I'm here to give you the tools, a ""Guided Grace"" excursion if you will. I'd love to hear about your journey back home to You, I'm only ever an email away. Remember, in all that you do, let love lead the way....read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/p5leUknogKNEYydIwMR6wGi5Ar62/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
