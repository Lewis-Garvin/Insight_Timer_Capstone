From their youth, they studied Bhakti Yoga, the timeless process of developing love and devotion for God. The ancient Vedic scriptures of India reveal that of all of the processes to attain the soul‚Äôs perfection, the simplest and best process is kirtan: the congregational singing of the names and glories of the Supreme Lord.
In 1996, they met a living saint, possessing all of the qualities of a loving devotee of God, Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Maharaja of Vrindavan, India. He accepted them as his disciples, enlightening them on the teachings, mantras and chants of the ancient saints and urged them to share this inspiration.
Yearly, since the year 2000, they travel around the world to more than 60 cities in 26 countries, holding kirtan concerts and seminars on bhakti yoga.
They have released many beautiful CD albums that are appreciated globally.
Kishori Mohan‚Äôs smooth and sweet voice brings a tranquil peace to the heart, while Sudevi‚Äôs heartfelt feeling mixed with her sweet and powerful voice evokes emotion from deep within the core of ones being.

The benefits for both children and adults were so evident that the course of my life thereafter has been changed.  The guided meditation, ""Relaxation Story,"" was created on the spot one day when a child I spent time with had an unusually rough time settling down for a much needed nap.  This child had all but abandoned naps as of recently, and Relaxation Story reinstated them (at least for a little while), and brought calm and understanding to us both, even when actual sleep did not result.  

I first attended an 8-week Foundational course in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) at Jefferson-Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine and practiced with a local sangha in Philadelphia in 2010 and 2011. Since then I have deepened my practice on many levels and continue to have great enthusiasm for sharing mindfulness with children and parents. I collected a variety of resources families find useful, including audio and picture books, on my Mindfulphillykids blog. Check out these resources by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking ""View web version,"" just above my photo and profile.
