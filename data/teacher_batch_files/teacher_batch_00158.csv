My path to falling in love with holistic wellness and spirituality began when I studied abroad in Thailand my junior year of college. I soon after began to explore the world of yoga and meditation. The power of the two practices became a vehicle for healing in my life by cultivating awareness around what needed the most attention on any given day. My teachers past and present have taught me the importance of creating a sacred space for connection.

Teaching slower practices such as yin and restorative yoga has become Yeradmi’s signature style as she is very passionate about guiding her students to feel calm and rejuvenated through stillness. Yeradmi hosts and leads annual wellness retreats in Santiago, Dominican Republic where she manages a vacation home year-round. Her greatest desire is to offer a shift in perspective, sense of ease and support in your journey.
