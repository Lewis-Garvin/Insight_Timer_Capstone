I've been searching for inner peace for a long time in the quest to manage my mind. I tried everything. I listened to many different meditations and meditation teachers. They were always very helpful but I felt like they were missing something.

I felt the calling to record my own, with a recommended activity at the end.

I wanted to get myself to take action at the end of the session and I just couldn’t find a teacher or even a simple meditation that brought that kind of approach to it. By taking action immediately after we’re in a state of mindfulness, our actions are more mindful. We even start to practice mindful living.

I started my site as a place to collect and publish my recordings as I make them and get feedback directly from my listeners I want to offer them free to stream anywhere. That's what brought me to Insight Timer, and I am so excited to be part of such a great platform!

Take a peaceful moment with us. ...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/L0IpY2xJB2S8jHCEeex52tsbtSN2/pictures/square_medium.jpeg

Healing has been a passion for as long as I remember. In my younger years I wished to be a Medicine Man, a Witch Doctor. This wish eventually led me to receive a degree in Anthropology, the study of human cultures, from the University of Pittsburgh. 

While in Pittsburgh, I had the opportunity to study Meditation, Qi Gong and various forms of healing. I began teaching Reiki, a form of energetic healing, in 1996 and continue to teach it and other forms of healing to this day. Through the years I have had the privilege of being a practitioner to thousands of people. 

I have a passion for experiencing new cultures, people and the intense diversity of our amazing world. This passion has led me around the globe. My travels and encounters with extraordinary people and diverse cultures have deepened, enriched, and colored my experience of life. 

I enrolled in the Tai Sophia Institute's three year Masters of Acupuncture Program after coming to know the Beauty and Power of Five Element Acupuncture through my own treatments. Everyday, with each of my patients, I am in awe of the transformation that acupuncture brings. This has created a passion for me in passing this healing possibility to as many people as I can! 

When I read the book 'Plant Spirit Medicine' by Eliot Cowan, a Huichol Shaman, in 1999, I was immediately intrigued by the possibility of using plants to help restore balance at our deepest level. I went on to study this medicine with Eliot and feel honored to share it with my patients. 

I began Kundalini Yoga in the winter of 2002 and it totally changed and enhanced my life. After some extraordinarily powerful experiences with this yoga, I decided to become a teacher so that I could share this amazing technology with those in my life. I joyfully extend my classes to all people regardless, of age, flexibility, shape, or size. My hope is that this ancient technology will enhance your life so that you can enhance the lives of those in your path. 

I currently reside in Mount Airy, Pa with my wife Amy, daughter Luna and dog Nimbus. 

My promise in life is to foster growth and creativity with joy and playfulness, to live right now to my fullest! To overflow with spirit, joy, compassion, outrageousness, creativity, brightness, wisdom and strength! And to be an inspiration and do whatever it takes to help others come to life most fully! 

Thank you for this opportunity to be with you! My hope is that our paths cross again. Enjoy this amazing journey, may you know the Ecstasy of Love, the Depth of Power, and the Tingling Vibrations of Life along your way! ...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/L6V1Y9D6z4M4e5T2A5z8V9m2w4X6C3F9w1y1C8B4z8T8W0W6R8K8D2H6G7U2B3h0m4h5T8u1Y5E4U2x3u4J8t1x8E7T2b3B6W7v6/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
