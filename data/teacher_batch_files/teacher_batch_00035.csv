While managing anxiety in the present, she also uses a cutting-edge therapy called EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) to help clear the roots of anxiety. 

Dr. Soule received her bachelors degree in psychology from the University of Texas at Austin, her masters degree in psychology from Columbia University, and her doctorate in counseling from Texas Tech. Before starting her private practice, she gained experience at Austin State Hospital, Roosevelt Hospital in New York, Safe Horizon emergency domestic violence shelter in Brooklyn, and a number of wonderful non-profit organizations in Fort Worth, The WARM Place, The Art Station, The Women's Center, and Trauma Support Services of North Texas. While living in New York, she co-authored a book chapter with Dr. Judy Kuriansky about the counseling model used in her nationally syndicated call-in radio show, Love Phones with Dr. Judy and Jagger.

Since returning to her native Texas, Dr. Soule has become a frequent speaker on integrating mindfulness and Western psychology, having first discovered the power of the present through Buddhist meditation classes.
