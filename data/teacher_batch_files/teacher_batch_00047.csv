Emma went on to become an expert in Communication and Wellness and has worked with marketing agencies and corporate clients in the UK, Australia and the USA over the last 10 years. During her time working in the corporate environment, Emma noticed a distinct rise in employee stress and increased isolation through remote working.

Emma is also a professional Coach, a Master of NLP and Time Line Therapy (and was even once a Stand-Up Comedienne!).  She is well known for her unique, professional and fun style of delivery which transcends through to everyone she works with.
