Mindful Istanbul’un kurucusu ve Mindfulness eğitmeni Selin Ilgaz, Fransa'da ve İngiltere'de Psikoloji ve Sinirbilim üzerine uzmanlaştı. Eğitimi süresince, her zaman ilgisini çeken Mindfulness konusunu akademik ve bilimsel düzeyde araştırma olanağı buldu.

Mindfulness pratiğinin beyine getirdiği değişiklikleri ve hayat kalitesine olan faydasını daha detaylı öğrenince, bunu bir de kendi deneyimleyip içselleştirmek istedi. Her sene katıldığı inzivalar sayesinde yoğunlaştırdığı pratik, zorluklarıyla ve faydalarıyla günlük hayatının bir parçası haline geldi ve Mindfulness pratiğinin birçok insana yardımı dokunacağına ikna olarak öğrendiklerini doğru ve bilimsel bir şekilde paylaşmak istedi.

2016 yılında İspanya’da bulunan, İngiltere onaylı Mindful Academy ile Mindfulness Temelli Stres Azaltma (MBSR) programının akreditasyonlu eğitmen sertifikasını aldı. Halen, bu doğrultuda İngiltere’de uygulanan Doğru Uygulama Prensiplerini takip ediyor. 

Istanbul'da Türkçe ve Fransızca 8 haftalık MBSR programları sunan Selin, bu platformda iki dilde de yönlendirmeli meditasyonlarını paylaşıyor.

La fondatrice de Mindful Istanbul et instructrice accréditée de pleine conscience, Selin Ilgaz, fait ses études en Psychologie et Neurosciences en France et en Angleterre. Pendant ses études, elle a l’occasion d’étudier académiquement et scientifiquement un sujet qui l’a toujours intéressée, celui de la pleine conscience et de la méditation.

Lorsqu'elle découvre les effets positifs que peut avoir la pratique de la ""méditation pleine conscience"" sur le cerveau et sur la qualité de vie, elle souhaite immédiatement en faire l'expérience. Elle participe ensuite à plusieurs sessions intensives de formation à la méditation et progressivement cette pratique de l'écoute et de l'observation de soi s'intègre à sa vie quotidienne. Convaincue des bénéfices de la pleine conscience, Selin souhaite partager ses connaissances de la manière la plus appropriée.

Elle suit, en 2016, une formation pour devenir instructrice du programme de Réduction du Stress Basée sur la Pleine Conscience (MBSR) auprès de Mindful Academy, membre du réseau professionnel international des instructeurs de MBSR basé au Royaume-Uni. Après plus de 500 heures de pratique encadrée, elle ouvre en septembre 2016 le centre Mindful Istanbul pour développer cette discipline en Turquie.

Actuellement, elle offre des programmes MBSR de 8 semaines à Istanbul en Français et en Turc. Elle partage sur cette platforme ses méditations guidées dans les deux langues. ...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/n9D2K3U2v8F0h4v2k9x9V0Z1J8h3Y4D4B1Z7B7m7e5M3J9e7b1m0S5n8c1M7H4M1T1y0e6m5T9y1v8y9j0N4x3H1q3s4P8t2X6b9/pictures/square_medium.jpeg

He lovingly shares the blessing of his clear, strong and subtle connection to the radiant energy behind The Divine Mother or Universal Consciousness. He offers special teachings in these audios: ""The Divine Mother Speaks"", a reading from the Vidya Gita (Song of Knowledge) from Tripura Rahasya  and “The Mother Mantra”. 

Shantiji received “The Mother Mantra” spontaneously, in the fall of 2014, while sitting quietly on Bell Rock, in the energetic red rock country of Central Arizona, USA. By sharing ""The Divine Mother Mantra"" with humanity via Insight Timer, Shantiji presents us with a great gift so that, we too- can experience the energy vibrations of Pure Consciousness, along with his chanting, therefore, enriching the depth and clarity in your meditaion practice.

""Sages and seekers of the Truth worship Her as a Life Current pervading their body, senses and mind. Without Her underlining support, nothing could exist.  So this mantra is a bridge to feel Her Eternal Presence within and to strengthen our conviction and recognition of Her unconditional Love arising from absorbing the Mantra’s vibration. 

Sacred scriptures declare, Salutations to the Mother Divine, who is the Abstract Intelligence, Absolute Knowledge, the Creatrix, and the Eternal Consciousness pervading the three phenomenal states of waking, dreaming and sleeping (hence “Tripura”).""

Shantiji's life has been dedicated to humbly sharing his unique life long influences from various wisdom traditions and the Non Dual path of living naturally, conciously and truthfully. Join him in this unique journey!
