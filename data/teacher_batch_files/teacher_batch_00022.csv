From what I tried to escape from the very early age. Of course I could not do this physically so I used to escape by finding somewhere quiet and going into my mind, either trying to forget life as it was for a few minutes a day or travelling to distant places.  This was something I have been doing from about the age of five years old. In my early teens I explained to someone what I had been doing and they told me I was Astro travelling.

Unfortunately when moving to Australia I found I know longer need to escape so I stopped doing this and lost all direction in life. In the 30 years of being in Australia I have completed four trades and no longer work at any of them, due to extreme pain in my back that at times was crippling and the only way to cope with this was with extremely high doses of morphine based painkillers

I found out later on in life that what I had been doing as a young child was actually meditating.  This was something I had taught myself to do. It wasn't until very recently but I learned how to ground myself and doing a body scan as part of my meditation really gave me the full benefits. 

I started meditating again in November 2016. My life once again regained focus direction and purpose. After starting to meditate again within a few weeks my brain regained focus and began to deal with my back pain and I gave up all medications and have not had any form of painkillers since then. 

I have since started to write some meditations and with the help of my partner we will record them, for the benefit of the world for either relaxation sleep or just a general well-being in life. I feel that meditation is the key to unlocking so much potential in your life.
