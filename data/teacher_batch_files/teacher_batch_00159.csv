This original heavy metal music was not just background music at ancient temples, nor entertainment for royalty; it appears that brain/mind entrainment into deeper states, and dis-entrainment into the ""state of no state"" facilitated by the complex, rich, textured harmonics and sub-harmonic beats was intentional. It is quite likely that exploration of the resulting states and non-states was a facet of the spiritual, for lack of better words, training and education; that the sounds acted as guides or stepping stones to making non-ordinary states become more ordinary, at least to those who practiced. And as we, through our ancestors, have heard sounds of natural, acoustic instruments for centuries or even millennia, there is something innately familiar, even sacred, about the sound of these and other antique musical instruments.

Much, maybe most music is about communicating a message of sorts, usually emotional, the dance of the mating ritual in various permutations, we know the stories. 33 Bowls does not directly do that, the intention is holding the space to facilitate and enhance whatever is present. What it is doing is providing a coherent, yet complex natural “signal” for the ears/ brain/mind/heart/CNS to entrain to and “drop” into a more relaxed, lower stress state of being. Our ears are not passive; they are active participants in sound, interacting with the environment in a way which leads to brain/mind entrainment with what we hear, whether it is shamanic drums, singing bowls, the cacophony of city noise, or the breath and heartbeat of someone close to us.

Deep Gratitude to countless generations of Artisans who listened to the Grand Muse; who practiced, even mastered the Art of expressing the resonance and coherence of the Universal Aum; who crafted these and other Singing Bowls.
