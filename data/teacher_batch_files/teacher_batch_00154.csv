Vivianne about her trainings: 
""For as long as I can remember, I'm fascinated by what motivates a person in life. I wanted to know what somebody can do to experience more happiness, success and creativity. What can anyone do him/herself to get more fun out of life, despite the circumstances?

Having been searching for the 'ideal' job, the 'ideal' social circumstances, the 'ideal' environment, I found out that happiness is not a destination. It is the little things, the little moments that give you your liveliness. To find these moments you can exercise your mind. You can make a conscious choice to train yourself for more happiness. And once you've made this choice, I'm here to guide you. Happy Mind, Happy Life.""
