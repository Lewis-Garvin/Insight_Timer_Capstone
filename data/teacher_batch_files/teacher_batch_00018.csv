""I am inspired by therapeutic practices which resource and balance us, and love sharing creative forms of Yoga Nidra, Meditation and Inner Exercises, Yoga Somatics, Body Therapy, and Restorative and Regenerative Yoga. As well as movement and meditation practices, I work therapeutically with clients using a range of powerful techniques, processes, and perspectives to support our inherent systemic health, and to manage symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, exhaustion, or feeling 'stuck'. I'm currently completing my Professional Doctorate in Psychotherapy with the University of Edinburgh, for which I'm exploring the bridge between Psychotherapy and Yoga.

""Within my comprehensive Therapeutic Yoga offerings, I specialise in Womb Yoga - empowering women through practices which support physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health throughout the cycles of life. I am particularly experienced in offering Yoga for Fertility, and Pregnancy and Postnatal support, including Doula/Birthkeeping support.

""I am honoured to have been able to study and work extensively with incredible teachers and therapists around the world. I take an integrative approach to my teaching, drawing inspiration from a range of traditions and styles, and synthesising the elements to best suit each unique student or gathering that comes together - while always teaching from my heart. 

""As much as I love to teach and share Meditation, Yoga, and associated practices, I am foremost a practitioner and student. I feel indebted to my teachers for their continued inspiration and support. With their guidance, I am continuing my deepening into practices of awareness, somatic movement, and regenerative rest, as well as exploring the nature of energy and integration in the physical and subtle bodies.

""Connection - with nature, culture, creatures, and the cycles and mysteries of our universe - fulfils and sustains me. When I'm not on my mat or buried in books, I love sharing conversation, good food, and laughter with my fellow adventurers in life. I also love to travel and explore new territories and possibilities - especially where there is warmth and sunshine!""...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/W1c7z5k7p4f9S5n3y9Q0M2w7g3K1C5d1a0r4n9J8q2c4c1C1G8Z8R2b3Y8w2H8U1U1V4X1w2H5S3R9F4e0B9X4Q2F1D1M1W5m0R6/pictures/square_medium.jpeg

Since then I have meditated with varying degrees of success. At first, using it only when stressed, meditation did not have a great impact. Then in 2001 I studied Yoga, Movement and Meditation in Rishikesh, India and made meditation part of a weekly practice alongside yoga. In 2006 I started learning about secular mindfulness meditation and started daily meditation practice. This led me to complete an MBSR course (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), taught by Michael Chaskalson, to consolidate my meditation practice. I attend at least one silent retreat each year to help deepen and support my practice and teaching.

In 2012 I decided to combine my interest in mindfulness meditation and my experience as a teacher by training to teach mindfulness. I undertook a reflective practice journal to deepen my practice and to get to know each meditation taught on Mindfulness-Based courses thoroughly. As well as the mindfulness teacher training, I also hold a Teaching Qigong for Health Certificate which I incorporate into my Mindfulness-Based courses....read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/v3N8x9a0J8Q6c0F2H7D4d0Q8E2q6F1c6v7W1p0z4m8z4B2L9Q7v7c2r9V5W5K7x4r7L0m2m3X9Q1W6w7e2k1k7g6F9U7a0g4T6L6/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
