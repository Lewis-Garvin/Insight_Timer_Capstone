I believe in the unlimited power of the human heart and mind. I call this inherent power. I belive in the power of heart and mind to self-correct and heal under proper cirucumstances, of peace and gratitude. 

I believe we have two choices in life, what to pay attention to, and how to respond. When we have the ability to control our minds to the extent of paying attention to what we want, and responding to how we want, we begin to live life to the fullest. 

I believe what's missing most in the world is self-love, and joy. When the mind is fully consumed by joy there is no room for anxiousness, or sorrow, or comparisons. I believe the true power in each of us comes from pure presence, and focus, and moments of joy and exhilieration. 

My life's work and passion is helping people discover their own unlimited abilities. I do this in my work as a professional hypnotherapist, and award-winning hypnosis instructor. I strive to bring peace, focus, and moment's of a-ha brillance and delight to my clients and students. 

I am a consciousness explorer, and belive hypnosis is on the LEADING EDGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. 

Join me in my journey. I will be sharing some of my favorite hypnosis recordings that I've created to clear your mind, and allow the awesomeness to be generated, organically from tapping into your own inherent power. ...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/h9v9t4p2y4h9M3c4S5a5v1V9q3P1E3M9G5C5H3E3R8N7q1X5w6r0m0p7y9r3S6j9q1m0X5D1x1t9R7a4b1S8d3d1L6w6P4q8q2w7/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
