身心靈諮商師｜作家：Rebirth 蛻變的重生旅程
幫助女人從情緒與感受中更認識自己，與神聖陰性力量連結，創造幸福的生活

About Grace:
靑少年時期與家人移居加拿大，畢業後從事時尙服裝業，但在2010年因感情的召喚，毅然決然放下加拿大的一切，重新踏上台灣這片對她既熟悉又陌生的土地。回到台灣後，因為人生地不熟，又碰到感情挫折，生活頓時失去方向和目標，反而因此踏入了一系列內在探索的旅程。

 Grace與埃及有深厚的連結，在她內在探索的旅程中，埃及佔著重要的角色。她在9年中去了埃及6次，也為此寫了一本以埃及神殿為背景的生命經驗的書。

​目前是專職身心靈工作者，藉由一對一個案與工作坊形式，引導人們從情緒和感受中更認識自己，並創造專屬自己的幸福人生。",https://users.insighttimer.com/q8c0W6R2C4a9B3Q1N2G8Y0G6v4z9t8H3z7A4C2N7s4t8Y7N5y3S8H3t8e4q1F7x8V5j6E0t0p2b1h8T0X4e1v6c8d3M9e9M8x4b7/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
