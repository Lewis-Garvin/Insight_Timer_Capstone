After 15 years in the field of early childhood education, feeling burnt out, and not fulfilled, illness led her to change course for the betterment of not only health, but bringing balance back to her mental, physical, and spiritual health. She completed her 200-hour yoga teacher training in 2015 and became an Ayurvedic wellness coach in December of 2019.
