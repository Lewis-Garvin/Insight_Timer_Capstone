When I visited Nepal in my mid-20s , I stayed in Ananda Yoga Centre where I worked closely with a guru who helped me establish my practice. I found that through deep meditation, I was able to discover my true essence.

I started studying stress and the effects it has on the human body quite extensively around 2012. I was very intrigued on how stress was the common denominator for disease in our community. I realised at that time that meditation was the antidote to stress in the body; this motviated me to study the relationship between mind, body and energy.

I realised that through meditation we could not only discharge stress but internally engineer a better version of ourselves, this was the inspiration for StressFit.
