Ruhe und Hinschauen haben mir geholfen. Hier begann meine Reise in die Welt der Meditation. Heute bin ich glücklich. Mit meiner Arbeite möchte ich so vielen Menschen wie möglich helfen, auch vom Kopf ins Herz zu kommen. Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass es unser Leben ganzheitlich verbessert. Das ist mein Beitrag für unsere Gesellschaft und für das Leben selbst.
Herzliche Grüße
