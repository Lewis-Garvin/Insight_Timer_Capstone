Prior to this shift, Shai had been a journalist, working for Israel’s major newspapers, as well as an award-winning young author. But in 2000, two days before his twenty-third birthday and after three years of fervent spiritual searching, he had a direct realization of the illusion of the personal self and underwent a blissful dissolution of his individuality into the ocean of universal consciousness. This inaugurated a long process of inner transformation, which kept him quiet and secluded for one year.
Ever since, this ecstatic realization has been his uninterrupted state, supported by both living and dead masters. His living teachers have included Tyohar and Dr. Gabriel Cousens, who lovingly initiated him into the Hindu Nityananda tradition. To both, he feels great respect and eternal gratitude.
