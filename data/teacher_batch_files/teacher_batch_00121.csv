Originally trained as a registered nurse, Prem spent a year working in labor and delivery at an inner-city hospital when she decided there had to be better options for women giving birth. She moved to Tucson, apprenticed with Lay Midwives, taught pre-natal yoga and birthing classes, and was blessed to attend more than 100 births. 

In 1982 she moved to Fairbanks, AK and along with her ex-husband was the director of a Kundalina Yoga and Meditation ashram for 8 years.  During this time, she taught hundreds of classes in stress management, yoga, meditation and pranayama for the University of Alaska and organized a yearly Peace Prayer Day to celebrate the unity of all paths.

In the early 90‚Äôs Prem moved her family to Chicago, where she was the co-founder of Choice Marketing, a successful Sales and Marketing company dedicated to the sale of natural and organic products in more than 40 states.   During this time, she continued her studies as a healer, receiving certification in Reiki, Crystal Healing, Hawaiian Energetics, Bach Flower Remedies, CranioSacral Therapy and Clinical Massage. 

In the fall of 2006, she began studying the LifeLine‚Ñ¢ Technique, being trained directly by founder, Dr. Darren Weissman and in 2007, she became a Certified LifeLine Practitioner. That same year, she had the blessing of meeting Katherine Woodward Thomas, the author of the groundbreaking work Calling in ‚Äúthe One‚Äù and Conscious Uncoupling.  After working with Katherine to transform her own life, Prem became certified and now works internationally as a Sr.  Calling in ‚Äúthe One‚Äù and Conscious Uncoupling Transformational Coach.  Her work brings together her many years of experience as a healer and teacher of transformation.  Combining practical ability with intuition and deep love and compassion, Prem will assist you in letting go of the painful patterns of the past, while offering the skills and capacities you need to create the loving and deeply caring relationships you have been yearning for.

Prem is a fully ordained Minister of Peace with the Beloved Community and the loving mother of Jeff Glidden and Bailey the cat. She lives in Florida with her Beloved Bob where they share a lovely condo overlooking a lake.  Her life is a wonderful example of what is possible and that it is never too late to change your life in miraculous ways.

Tremper, NY, where I took a life vow 'to be of service.' Looking for a monastery closer to my home on the West Coast, I subsequentially entered residential training at Great Vow Zen Monastery. 

In 2002 Roshi Chozen Bays, MD, gave me lay ordination (jukai) and the dharma name Daishin ('boundless heart'). Chozen and Hogen Bays, Roshi, continue to be my primary guides at a distance and during silent retreats (sesshin). In preparation to a life and work as a 'monk in the world,' I completed the year-long End of Life Practioner Program (Metta Institute, 2006), took up volunteer work in palliative care, and employment in hospice spiritual care. In 2010 I added the foundational course in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD, to my repertoire.

For the last 15 years my service practice has included such tasks as guiding mindfulness-related groups for people living with cancer, teaching a range of courses at a community centre, assisting corporate groups in using mindfulness to live with stress in the worksplace, and presenting conference workshops in community wellness.
