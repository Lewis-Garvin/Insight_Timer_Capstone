I still remember making my weekly pilgrimage to the local public library. I couldn’t wait to pick up the latest volume of the ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’ series which were a hands-down favorite. Even at that age, something inside of me knew that, regardless of my circumstances, I would always be the master of my own destiny.

20 years later, anyone on the outside looking in would have assumed that I had managed to create an ideal life for myself. I was the first person in my family to earn a medical degree and I was earning a comfortable living as a psychiatrist. By objective standards, I had it made. By my own standards, I was miserable. Although my residency training encouraged me to really dig deep in order to understand all of the factors that contributed to one’s overall health, the reality of practice was that I suddenly found myself being expected to distill the entirety of one’s complex and nuanced life experience into a 15 minute med check.

Disillusionment quickly gave way to burnout and I was convinced that I was destined to spend the rest of my life counting the days until retirement. I had forgotten that sense of agency that had been so salient as a child. My wake-up call came after I literally passed out during the middle of a busy clinic day. As I was being wheeled to the emergency department, my thoughts weren’t focused on getting well, but how on earth am I going to manage to reschedule all of my afternoon patients when I’m booked solid for the next month? I knew then that something had to change. The seed for my private practice had been planted and several months later, I welcomed my first patients to Imara Health and Wellness.
