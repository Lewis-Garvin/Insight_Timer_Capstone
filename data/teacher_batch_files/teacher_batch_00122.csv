Oon vahvasti sitä mieltä että jooga on elämän parhaita juttuja ja yritän tehdä elämästäni kokonaisvaltaista joogaamista tavalla tai toisella.
Kävin ensimmäisellä joogatunnillani joskus varmaankin 2001. Kaverin mukana siis menin. Olin niin kankea, että siitä jäi mieleen lähinnä joogamisen olevan todella rankkaa. Arvelisin että vaikeutta oli myös pysähtymisessä paikalleen.

Joogaminen on jatkunut siitä eteenpäin, joskus säännöllisemmin ja joskus pitempien taukojen muodossa, kunnes vuonna 2014 joogasta tuli jokapäiväinen, suorastaan elämäntapa, laittautuessani hynttyyt yhteen henkilön kanssa, joka silloin valmistui joogaopettajaksi.

Tällaiset asiat johtaa eteenpäin ja tämä johti siihen, että menin 2017 Villa Mandalan joogaopettajakoulutukseen ja matkalle on osunut tämän jälkeen monenlaista hyvinvointiin ja mielenhallintaan liittyvää opiskelua.

Viimeaikojen haasteisiin kuuluu loppuunpalaminen päivätyössäni, josta jäin pois 2018 jouluna, ja siirryin kokonaan työskentelemään hyvinvoinnin pariin.
Paljon matkustelleena ja maailmaa monelta eri kantilta nähneenä ihmisenä, kun vanhemmaksi elän, ja omalla joogapolulla pidemmälle edetessä, olen yhä enemmän ja enemmän sitä mieltä, että maailman kaunein maisema on omien silmäluomien takapuoli.

Joogan ja rentoutumisen opettaminen on mulle sellainen tehtävä, jossa koen pääseväni toteuttamaan sellaista, joka auttaa ihmisiä löytämään elämästä valoisia puolia ja tuntemaan itsensä paremmin. Se oman sisäisen maailman kauneus löytyy jokaiselle lähempää kuin monikaan aavistaa ja sen löytämiseen on jokaisen oma tehtävä, johon saa kaverin mukaan kun pyytää.
