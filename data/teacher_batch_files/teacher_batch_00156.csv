We're a small team of heart-centered innovators dedicated to helping busy people wake up to deep connection with five-minute guided meditations that encourage deep connected sharing.

Got time for a five-minute escape to the landscape of your imagination? Studies show that guided meditation makes you brighter, quicker, and happier!
A single Wacuri Journey will excite you about the possibilities of what lies on the other side of your mental barriers… So imagine what will happen when you can’t get enough and look forward to your next journey every day.

The Problem: Disconnection. In our highly “connected” world, even in groups and organizations, many people nevertheless feel alone, alienated, suffering a sense of separation from self and others. Feeling disconnected and disengaged saps energy and productivity, damages morale, and depresses creativity, and leads to poor performance and general unhappiness. Disconnection is bad for life and bad for business.

The Solution: Deep Connection. Wacuri, (short for wake up curious) allows people to make deep connections quickly and to bridge the gap in relationships through brief five-minute guided mindfulness journeys followed by sharing discoveries. Participants report greater energy and alignment with others and team cohesion, and personal breakthroughs in mood, creativity, and greater wellbeing. 

Our Vision: Wake Up Curious and Develop Deep Connection
