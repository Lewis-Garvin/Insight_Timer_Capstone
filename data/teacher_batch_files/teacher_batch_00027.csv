My deepest interest lies in Yoga Nidra. For those who are not familiar with the practice, let me explain. Yoga Nidra is a relaxation technique that involves listening to a guided meditation delievered by a teacher. Nidra translates itself as 'Sleep' in Sankrit, but practioners will realise that Yoga Nidra is not exactly 'Sleep'. In Nidra, your mind remains conscious and awake but the body goes into deep sleep. 

I hope you enjoy my recordings and that it helps you heal the parts of you that you thought was incapable of being healed.  I hope it helps with your pain, and all the sufferings you have encountered. I hope it makes you strong and i hope you will love again. 

Namaste my friends.
