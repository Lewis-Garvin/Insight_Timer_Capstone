Solution Focused Hypnotherapy uses practical, modern and well-researched strategies to help people make significant, positive changes in their lives in a relatively short period of time.

With Solution Focused Hypnotherapy, we look at what the client would like to achieve (the solution) rather than at whatever prompted them to visit us (the problem).

In essence the approach focuses on the present and future and not on the past. The Hypnotherapist asks the client to consider their preferred future, for instance, what would be better if the problem had improved? What would have changed? This enables the client’s possible solutions to become more obvious and gives the client a goal to work towards.

Hypnosis itself reduces anxiety and this is done very simply through relaxation and visualisation, allowing the client to focus on the positive aspects of their life, encouraging a shift in perspective.

I see my clients in central Bristol at:

19 Lower Redland Road, Bristol, BS6 6TB and also The Bedminster Family Practice, Regent Rd, Bristol, BS3 4AT

I am also able to see clients who are unable to leave their home to see me or anywhere in the world via Skype.

My experience with meditation and energy healing work started over 20 years ago. Since then, I have been studying many different healing and meditation techniques and modalities, first for my own growth and health, and later to support others as well.

I enjoy supporting people on their journey, and am grateful to witness them discover and embrace their Divine Truth, a process that is always humbling and awe-inspiring.

My work focuses on supporting to discover and experience our own Divinity, transmuting any patterns and believe systems, that might be limiting and restricting. I use varies different modalities, as I believe every journey is different and unique.

Healing modalities I offer are Meditation, VortexHealing® Divine Energy Healing, Soul Realignment™/ Akashic Record Readings, Mayan Light Language Grids, Light Grids and Integrated Energy Therapy®. Having studied, practiced and taught many different modalities, sessions can be influenced also by Universal channeled Light Language, Divine Intervention, Hopi Technique, Mayan Electromagnetic Restoration, Reiki, Gyrotonic® and Shamanic practices.  www.danielahoff.org...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/v3Z4t0g4f5h2D5c2Q9L7B2s1a9n3D7k2m9J4P8f1c7p2Y2N8V1V2V3M2n2Y0m4d9n1B1F8M6s0C0F4X7x4v6D0r9X7w8M9a5b7q1/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
