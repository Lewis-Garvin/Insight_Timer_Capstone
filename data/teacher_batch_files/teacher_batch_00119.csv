A tradição do Yoga ensina-nos que os possíveis receios ou desconfortos pessoais não deverão nunca prevalecer quando confrontados com um bem maior. Ao fazer isso aproximamos-nos do ideal de uma vida ética em que o maior beneficio para todos começa a ser o foco do praticante, não meramente os seus gostos e preferências pessoais.

She combines the art of Mandala with meditation and mindfulness practices, offering an innovative and powerfully transformative experience. The meditations you will hear are guided journey meditations that will actually bring you metaphysically into the work itself, balancing you, relaxing you, healing you and filling you with light. You will walk into the mandala. The thumbnail for the meditation is the piece you will be journeying into. Please visit my website to expand the image so you can see more detail.

From the classical Indian language of Sanskrit, the word Mandala can be loosely translated to mean circle. But the Mandala is far more than just a simple shape. It embodies wholeness, representing the structure of life itself, a cosmic diagram that shows us our relatedness to the infinite, that which extends both beyond and within our bodies and minds. The Mandala can be seen as a container for essence, energy or spirit.  A journey into the self and to the connectedness with all that is.

I was introduced to Mindfulness by a colleague in my work as a Community Mental Health Nurse. Initially, my practice was based in Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and my own practice was a case of stopping and starting.
My MBCT practice developed mostly though work and seeing the benefits of a Mindfulness based approach in my life and my work with Patients. I completed a course in teaching MBCT in 2016. I Co facilitate occasional MBCT Days of Mindfulness and work 1:1 with those who cannot attend a group. 
I have been a member of the York Sangha, practicing in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh since November 2014 and regularly facilitating since  March 2015. Since starting with York Sangha I have grown and developed my practice and experience of Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings. Thays teachings and the ethics contained in the Five and Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings were the things that were  missing from my practice and they have had a great impact on my life. I have been drawn to the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings. And in April 2018 I  made an additional commitment to practice and follow the Fourteen Mindfulness trainings by becoming and aspirant to the Order of Interbeing.  
I have uploaded some MBCT meditations whilst I was training and I intend to record some more MBCT and also meditations in the Plum Village/Thich Nhat Hanh  tradition as I travel my aspirant journey. I intend to upload these meditations to help share Thays teachings on Insight Timer.
A lotus for you, a Buddha to be
