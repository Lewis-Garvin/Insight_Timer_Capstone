Jestem psychologiem, trenerem, psychoterapeutą, wieloletnim instruktorem medytacji klasycznej, certyfikowanym nauczycielem MBSR i terapeutą MBCT oraz założycielem Instytutu Uważności i Psychoterapii. Ukończyłem pierwszy w Polsce trening nauczycielski, prowadzony przez niemiecki Institute for Mindfulness Based Approches. 
Uważność jest darem. Kilkunastoletnia praktyka uważności pod okiem wspaniałych nauczycieli z różnych tradycji, liczne odosobnienia medytacyjne, ukończenie kilkunastopoziomowego treningu umysłu w tradycji Szambali (od wielu lat jestem też istruktorem tej techniki medytacyjnej) i wiele innych programów i warsztatów medytacyjnych w Polsce, Europie i Azji odmieniło mój sposób patrzenia na życie i moje funkcjonowanie. Moją ambicją i marzeniem jest możliwość dzielenia się tym najwspanialszym z darów.
Posiadam wieloletnią praktykę w prowadzeniu terapii indywidualnych oraz warsztatów profilaktycznych i rozwojowych w tematyce redukcji stresu, komunikacji w grupie, uzależnień, autoprezentacji, asertywności dla młodzieży szkolnej i osób dorosłych. Głównym obszarem moich zainteresowań i specjalizacji jest tak zwana Trzecia Fala terapii pozanwczo-behawioralnej (MBSR/MBCT, DBT, ACT, CMT/CFT, MCT), w którym to kierunku nieustannie się rozwijam. Uczestniczyłem w warsztatach i szkoleniach prowadzonych m.inn. przez: Paula Fultona, Jona Kabat-Zinna, Paula Gilberta, Andrew Olendzkiego i Alexandra Berzina. Wielokrotnie prowadziłem warsztaty i wykłady z zakresu psychoterapii i uważności oraz samospółczucia m.inn. na Uniwersytecie Warszawskim, Uniwersytecie im. Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego i w Wyższej Szkole Gospodarki Euroregionalnej.

Prywatnie jestem zapalonym rowerzystą i zawsze kiedy mogę wybieram ten środek komunikacji, co w mieście takim jak Warszawa wymaga nieustannej uważności. Uwielbiam podróżować i chodzić po górach, szczególnie w rejonie Indii i Nepalu ale potrafię też docenić piękno i bogactwo naturalne Polski. Fascynuje mnie ludzka kultura i mądrość we wszystkich jej odsłonach.
