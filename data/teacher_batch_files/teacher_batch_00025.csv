While at Shimer, I read Martin Buber’s “I and Thou” which had a profound impact and gave me a glimpse of an expanded notion of self. Reading Buber led me to the study of contemplative practices.

I received my Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Adam’s State University in Colorado. It is here where I learned to form effective relationships with my clients. Research shows that the relationship between client and therapist is of utmost importance.

I’ve studied with some thoughtful and generous teachers in the fields of psychotherapy, philosophy, and contemplative practice (primarily Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Yogis). I completed a 2 year certificate in contemplative psychotherapy at the Nalanda Institute.  At the Nalanda institute I learned how to take the entire Tibetan Buddhist path (Lamrim) and use it to support physical, mental and emotional health.
