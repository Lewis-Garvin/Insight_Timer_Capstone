After the session, my body was so relaxed and yet energized, my mind slowed down and I could think and speak more clearly. My mind and my body were extremely grateful for that experience. I realized there is so much more for me to explore in the ancient teachings of Yoga Nidra, and so I did.

Rise into whoever they dream of becoming and to show them how to live full, happy, contented lives no matter what they have been through.  I do this through EFT and YOGA.

For me EFT & YOGA provided a holistic approach to my trauma recovery and I was inspired by the amazing changes I was seeing in my own life so I trained as a Trauma Conscious Yoga teacher and an EFT Practitioner.
