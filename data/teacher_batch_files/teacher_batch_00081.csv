She quit her lucrative (but soul-sucking) corporate sales job, bought a one-way ticket to New Zealand and a sturdy backpack and went about (pardon the cliché) finding herself. Three months of solo hiking in rainforests, swimming with dolphins, and running off the edge of a cliff to see if she would fly (she did, thanks to her paragliding partner) convinced her to return home to start a personal coaching business to help others find meaning and purpose in their one, wild and precious life.

I have been practicing Yoga for twelve years and teaching for five. Through the past five years, I have been on a journey to freedom and have done the amount of work on myself that some people won’t even attempt in a lifetime. Through spiritual practices such as Meditation, Pranayama, Kirtan, Sweat Lodge, Sounds Healing, and Energetic healing and probably some other things that I have forgotten about, I burned away old parts of my life that weren’t working anymore, or let’s face it, never felt like they worked at all, and what remains is a mostly compassionate human, who is doing her daily best to live a full and honest life with love and grace. 

I learned that there are no boxes to be checked, and the burning and learning need to continue so that more of my trues self can be free to live with vulnerability and courage.  I hope to pass what I've learned on to you and help you to realize the magnificent nature of your own true self!
