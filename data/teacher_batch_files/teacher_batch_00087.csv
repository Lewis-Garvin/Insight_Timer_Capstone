I used to be very stressed and much of my day was spent just getting from one task to the next. As life offered me more chances to grow i.e. more busy-ness and stressors, I came to a point where I was ready to crumble. I knew I couldn’t go on. I knew I needed to change or I’d get sick. 

Meditation was one of the techniques that literally pulled me back from the brink. I love creating guided visualisations for others, as I know how powerfully it has affected my life.

I’m an experienced facilitator, speaker and trainer. I run classes and workshops in Art of Feminine PresenceTM, meditation and “Be Calm, Be Connected, Be Genuine - Listening skills for busy people"". 

I also work privately with women and men who are ready to step up in their business and personal lives. Through powerful, effective practices and awareness around your personal blocks, I create individual, ""tailored for you"" programs to help you recognise your self worth, build presence, confidence and peace, so that you can create healthy, nourishing relationships, genuine connections with clients and pleasure and joy in your life again.   ...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/j1b0K6K8x2q1n1H8E3y8E9Q5t3B7R4f0H6Y6m1r4n2v4t1C9e4k8M1N0P0V6P7y9C6L4z8Q4E6D1G4F6q6t3W8g3j8N1M0E3n0U5/pictures/square_medium.jpeg

What a fabulous medium for sharing life changing and nurturing treats? It’s an exciting time that there are so many rich and abundant resources freely available to everyone, so am very happy to be here (or hear!)

I’m a bit quirky, and home-spun at times. I like to share my thoughts on life, love, passion and explore why we're here. To me, there can be no greater question than understanding how to live with integrity, in peace, joyfully connected to others and enjoying life's rich lessons. I hope this comes out in my work. It's no doubt why I began studying astrology, re-programming the mind and meditation in my 20s. I've yet to find anyone who doesn't want to 'know about themselves' or learn ways to find their own resources easily and effortlessly. That’s why I combine life-affirming hypnotic suggestions into all my recordings.

My mission is to make coaching and astrology accessible, practical and fun for everyone. Whether you want a shot of astrological advice within a meditation or a deeper, nourishing experience, there’s something here for you. I set up the group 'Explore healing through Astrology' on Insight Timer. Pop over to see me there, if the subject interests you!

As you might expect with my ‘questing’ nature, I have lived abroad a few times, and trained in many healing modalities. Before becoming a mother in 2011, I had a long and interesting career consulting bluechips on self development and performance. I was happy to let that go, and after my first child was born I decided to work from home with real people wanting meaningful goals.

I now find myself working from home, whilst touring Portugal with my generous and funny husband, insanely brilliant six year old son and bonkers two year old daughter. And that feels really good.

Whether you choose to listen to me for astrological insight, healing or refreshment, my end goal is that you feel great and notice improved clarity. Why not have a listen and see how I work for you? Looking forward to connecting in the near future.

With much love,

Louisa x
