We incorporate many different genres of music, various styles of instrumentation, tempos, and frequencies to create a sonic wave of energy that will be both peaceful and transformational.
 
Listening to Smile is the brainchild of Ian Morris, a multi-instrumentalist, he instinctively sought solace in music. It was during this time of very poor health that he came across information about the sacred healing potentials of sound/vibration and began to study further. What he can then best describe as a combination of divine inspiration, timing, and skill set all merged. He began creating and producing compositions of tones and frequencies which lead me to personally reclaim my health. In addition to this personal physical healing, he was simultaneously embarking on a spiritual journey.  Through this, the power of collective intent and meditation became clear to him. When focused intent and meditation was combined with the frequencies and tones he was creating, an entirely new experience was born in the form of the Sonic Meditation.
