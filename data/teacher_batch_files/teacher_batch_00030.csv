My life has completely changed since starting my meditation practice at the end of 2012. I have lost 40 pounds and kept it off. My relationships have improved with everyone in my life. I am more compassionate, loving, understanding and patient than I ever thought possible. I am now a certified health coach and have spoken internationally in front of audiences of hundreds of people regarding my experience with energy. I have attended over 250 hours of lecture and practice on the physics and neuroscience regarding the effects of advanced meditation. 

From all this work and continued connection to source, my passion for teaching emerged and I have trained hundreds in basic meditation techniques, life balance & self-appreciation. 

My intention is to mentor those who seek creative ways to unlock natural serenity, balance and mindfulness in their lives. To help them discover or even enhance their unique spiritual connection.
