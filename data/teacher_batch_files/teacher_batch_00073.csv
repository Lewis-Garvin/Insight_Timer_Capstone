Jivan was born with the name Mathew Douglas Wiggett. Strong willed, and interested in exploring, Mathew began meditating when he was 17 in the tiny town of 2500 where he grew up.  His interest in spirituality led him to pursue a minor in comparative religious studies, where he met Professor Robert Gussner (Jina) whose approach focused on the experiential element of spiritual practices in contrast to the intellectual investigation of different religions. This element of experiencing first hand is fundamental to the book offered here. After graduating from college, Mathew traveled to India for four months, his first of many journeys around the world to learn from various traditions. There he took part in a variation of the Indian tradition of Sanyas (renunciation) in which he was given the name Jivan Amara, meaning immortal spirit or immortal life. On returning to the US he legally took on the new name. Jivan has lived and studied spiritual traditions in a number of places around the world; most recently Beijing & Shanghai where he furthered his study of qigong, San Diego close to Advaita teacher Francis Lucille, and at the time of this publishing is currently residing in Crestone, CO. Jivan supports himself financially through software development. In addition to meditation, Jivan enjoys hiking, snowboarding, and playing guitar.

Je suis une femme créative, avec pleins d’idées en tête, j’adore les couleurs. Le hêtre pleureur est mon arbre préféré, il m’accompagne partout où je vais et ma fleur préférée c’est la rose rouge. Je ressens un amour particulier pour les animaux; ma chatte Plume est très précieuse à mes yeux.
Mon parcours de vie est atypique et rempli de souffrances, mais il m’a permis de devenir celle que je suis aujourd’hui, alors je le remercie!
Mon enfance a été un mixte entre insécurité et abandon, tout en étant, fort heureusement pour moi, comblée par l’amour de mes grands-parents. 
Mon adolescence reste une période critique dans mon cheminement, car j’ai perdu le pilier de ma vie, mon grand-papa. Je considère qu’il m’a tout donné, sans conditions, qu’il a été le papa que je n’aurais jamais eu sans lui sinon et surtout qu’il m’a appris à être aussi forte et droite dans mes bottes. Aujourd’hui, après 20 ans sans lui, je réussi à me reconnecter à son être divin. J’ai compris et ressenti qu’il était présent pour moi, de manière différente, c’est vrai, mais tout autant fortement quand même. J’ai toujours eu le sentiment qu’un jour on se retrouverait…maintenant je sais que ce n’est pas encore le moment!
Toutes mes expériences, malgré leurs difficultés me permettent d’accéder à une empathie sincère envers les autres, de savoir vraiment de quoi je parle, car dans la plupart des cas je l’ai vécu moi aussi. Alors vous pouvez d’avance être certain qu’il n’y aura pas de jugements de ma part ou de gênes à avoir de la votre. La bienveillance et le respect marquent ma démarche de développement personnel.
Je suis une personne certes qui a souffert et qui a encore des choses à travailler en amont, mais je véhicule par ce fait, un message important: l’ESPOIR. Je suis une survivante de ma vie, comme vous l’êtes de la vôtre… Depuis plusieurs années je chemine vers mon bien-être, car j’ai décidé de ne plus être cette petite fille, victime, sans défenses, cette ado brisée et insouciante et encore moins cette jeune adulte perdue et pleine d’angoisses. Aujourd’hui je suis une femme forte, qui porte en elle son histoire, la vraie, sans ambages et qui assume de plus en plus sa part sensible. Je suis prête à vivre cette nouvelle vie, au côté de la lumière. Je la vie déjà et j’oeuvre à travers elle pour guider les autres vers la lumière du phare que j’ai trouvé dans la nuit. Grâce à mon entourage et des thérapies naturelles engagées, je me suis reconstruite. J’ai tout simplement construit un nouveau chemin!
J’espère pouvoir partager quelques pas avec vous…...read more",https://users.insighttimer.com/N3n1G2Y1Z3f8d2m8U3f7X5q1D2D6W1W0X6M8T6q5U1Q8t7z6C9V0Z7P9h1x5V9U9q2P1D3Z6Q6X4e3g7G5d0B2F5V7g0J3g5S4D8/pictures/square_medium.jpeg
